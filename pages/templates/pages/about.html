    <h1>Hello World! ðŸ˜€</h1>
 <p>
    I've been working with Python for the last few years, mostly as a Data-Many Hats-Something :P
</p>
<p>
    I have a Bachelor's degree in Sociology from the University of Buenos Aires and a bunch of experience in data engineering and analysis, which helps me connect the dots between technical stuff and what people actually need.
</p>
<p>
    My skills cover a lot of technologies, mainly everything that has to do with the 'Modern Data Stack'. 
</p>
<p>
    I also like to pitch in on open-source projects, like helping out with the Spanish translation of Pythonâ€™s official documentation.
</p>
<p>
    I'm always up for new challenges, especially where data, technology, and society mix.
