    <h1>Hello World! ðŸ˜€</h1>
 <p>
     My name is Carlos and I've been working with <strong>Python</strong> for the last few years, mostly as a Data-Many Hats-Something :P. Having successfully <strong>transitioned from Data Analyst to Data Engineer</strong>, I am now eager to focus fully on <strong>Software Development</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    I have a Bachelor's degree in <strong data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="right" data-bs-original-title="Apparently, I'm the only Sociologist in the world who uses vim.">Sociology</strong> from the University of Buenos Aires and extensive experience in data engineering and analysis, which helps me connect the dots between technical stuff and what people actually need.
</p>
<p>
    My skills cover a wide range of technologies, mainly everything related to the <strong>'Modern Data Stack'</strong> (maybe post-modern!).
</p>
<p>
    I also like to contribute to <strong>open-source projects</strong>, such as helping with the Spanish translation of <a href="https://github.com/python/python-docs-es"> Pythonâ€™s official documentation</a> or organizing <a href="https://eventos.python.org.ar/events/pyday-hurlingham-2024">PyDay Hurlingham</a>, a local Python conference.
</p>
<p>
    If you have something interesting to share about intersection of data, technology, and/or society, don't hesitate to contact me!
